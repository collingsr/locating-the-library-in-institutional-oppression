#Locating the Library in Institutional Oppression

##1. Introduction

###1.1 Topological Survey

The proposition of attempting to understand where the library is located within institutional oppression is a difficult one. First, because institutional oppression itself actively works to disguise, erase, and obfuscate its traces and consequences. It is very much the proverbial devil whose greatest trick is to convince the world that it does not exist. Second, because people sincerely and truly love libraries. They love libraries for a variety of reasons but many tend to associate libraries with a cluster of values that is difficult to gainsay without appearing to side with some fairly unsavoury and undesirable values. 

Neil Gaiman recently wrote this about libraries:

>Libraries are about freedom. Freedom to read, freedom of ideas, freedom of communication. They are about education (which is not a process that finishes the day we leave school or university), about entertainment, about making safe spaces, and about access to information. [^1]

How do you begin a project of locating the library within institutionalized oppression when this quotation represents a common view of libraries? Albeit, even if we understand this as being idealistic and unrealistic, a less idealistic understanding of libraries still frames them largely as institutions for good but ones that, perhaps, occassionally fail to live up to their values.

How do we reconcile this understanding of libraries with the very real fact that we continue to live in a deeply inequitable society? A society where oppression fundamentally structures all of our political, social, and economic relationships and institutions? Exploring the topology and geography of institutional oppression is a perilous activity and frought with many dangers. Starting an expidetion with the goal of finding a much beloved institution will require careful planning.

###1.2 Plotting a course

This excursion shall begin by attempting to answer this question: "What are libraries?". It is a question fraught with difficulties and contested areas: however, in a grand sense the ultimate goal of this excursion will be to provide one kind of answer to this question. 

The first answer I'll approach is what the library is in the imagination of the 'public,' as expressed by the articles, defenses, and love letters to the library written by people of varying levels of fame and notoriety. Then I shall attempt to explicate what the library is in the imagination of its labour force using various screed, odes, and rants. 

Next I will delve into the history of libraries to hopefully uncover what libraries were intended to be. This will involve understanding and engaging the notion that libraries are institutions that have been shaped and created as a means to embody and enforce a particular ideology. 

Neither will necessarily be *the* answer, but perhaps they'll contribute to a nuanced and complex understanding of libraries. One which disrupts and challenges the fairly dominant narratives of the library as wholly good by exploring the ways that the library can be bad. 

##2. The Domain of Discourse

###2.1 Institutional oppression

Perhaps one of the more critical elements of this discussion requiring absolute clarity about is the boundaries of what is meant by 'institutional oppression' and what is not. The notion of institutional or systemic oppression speaks to the ways that certain behaviours, attitudes, and ideologies become formalized in the various social, political, and economic organizations, groups, structures, etc. It is about how abstract ideas become reified and concrete through a long, but dynamic and constantly changing, process of human social organization. 

It isn't about how these behaviours, attitudes, and philosophies are emobied in individuals. However, individuals most certainly do come to embody these things and act as the agents of their institutions. Just as other individuals within this system are oppressed by the same institutions. Nonetheless, this isn't an examination of the moral and ethical implications of being oppressive as an individual. 

The focus will remain on institutional oppression for all the ways that how these institutions are structured, created, and maintained reduce the ability for individuals to make a decision to not embody these values. The easiest example within libraries is controlled vocabularies like the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) or the Dewey Decimal Classifications (DDC). There are several well known examples, like the fact that non-Christian religions within the DDC are forced to share a narrow number range because they weren't created with a notion to include them. 

This means that catalogers, whatever their individual beliefs and values *must* continue to enforce this ideological (and white-centric) belief that non-Christian religions are not important (or as important as the Christian ones). The way the DDC is set up, a single cataloger deciding that this exclusion and marginalization of non-Christian religions within the DDC is unacceptable, can do very little to change the overall system. They cannot assign some other number within the DDC and have it be valid or coherent. If they were to use some other system of classification, the resulting records wouldn't work with current technologies, rendering the items inaccessible. Within such a system, making an ethical choice is very difficult on an individual basis. However, focusing on the system or institution allows us to explore solution that would allow individuals to make better decisions. 

Institutional oppression is about the system and processes that we use in our daily lives that, by the very nature of how they've been constructed and devised, exclude, marginalize, and oppress some people to the benefit of others. As such, attempting to locate the library in institutionalized oppression is about identifying the processes and systems within libraries that that instantiate oppressive values and beliefs not necessarily restricted to the library. As a consequence, libraries must also be analyzed in relation to other social, political, and economic institutions that act upon the library and that the library, in turn, impacts. 

###2.2 The Enlightenment

Perhaps the current, definitive work on the relationship between libraries and the enlightenment is, well, _Libraries and the Enlightenment_ by Wayne Bivens-Tatum. Chapter 1 of the book is dedicated to discussing what the enlightenment actually is and lays out the parameters for Bivens-Tatum's discussion. His discussion largely rests on a distinction drawn between enlightenment as historical period and enlightenment as a "set of philosophical and political principles that emerged from this period in history"[^2].

Bivens-Tatum also careful to note his bias towards the enlightenment when he writes: 

>I will be discussing the principles of the Englightenment in a positive way -- in line with numerous historians and philosophers over the last 300 years -- the past few decades have also seen a negative reaction to certain aspects of Enlightenment, or sometimes...[^3]to distortions of Enlightenment thought taken for the real thing.[^4]

In the same spirit, I'll state outright that I think the enlightenment is and was evil. I don't use the word 'evil' lightly, but I'm hard pressed to think of any other word to describe a set of philosophical and political ideas that directly led to the deaths of millions of people and the subjugation of pretty much the entire world under white rule[^5].

My approach to understanding the enlightenment is more holistic than Bivens-Tatum. My general perspective is to understand the enlightenment as an ideology. We cannot separate the philosophical and political ideas of the enlightenment from its historical context. Moreover, we cannot separate how these ideas formed the conceptual basis for many out currently existing political, economic, and social systems.

One of the things I find truly interesting about the myth-making surrounding the enlightenment, is that very few historians/thinkers appear to make any connection between the enlightenment and the material, historical conditions that helped create the movement to begin with. A lot of historical accounts place the (white) enlightenment as started sometime in the 18th centure, mid-1700's[^16]. About the same time as the industrial revolution. 

As I did my research for this paper, I found that (like most white writing on European history and thought), there was a curious lack of critical analysis about what helped *cause* the enlightenment. Most of the research either focuses on what the enlightenment is or how the enlightenment influenced the world. The other interesting events happening during this period is the British and French getting involved in the colonization of the world (prior to this point, it Spain and Portugal had the main colonial empires). 

We also know that the industrial revolution wouldn't have been possible without colonialism, since the economic impact of the resource extraction of the colonies, the genocide of Indigenous peoples, and the Atlantic Slave Trade, all had a massive impact on the colonial powers. However, while we can trace the influence of the colonies on the economic and social contexts of Europe, very little is said about the influence that these colonies had on the European intellectual tradition. I'm suddenly curious to see an analysis of the enlightenment that at least partially engages the notion that some part of the tradition was born from a need to both explain the vast, new world and to justify the white conquest of it.

Viewed from this angle, it becomes clearer why/how it was possible for a tradition of thought that believed "that facts and theories about nature are decided by standards of scientific reasoning theoretically common to all human beings"[^16] was also able, during this age of enlightened thought, to craft a system of biological/scientific racism that -- obviously based on objective observation and reasoning -- just happened to place white people as the most beautiful, most advanced, most rational: therefore, the best race of people on the planet. From this perspective one can partially attribute the rise of enlightenment thought as a means to justify the genocide and murder of millions of people for, by and large, base economic motivations (ie, greed). In this way, we can also understand the enlightenment values of 'rationality' and other signs of 'civilization' as ways to establish the superiority of whiteness and to mark the rest of the world as 'other.'

This also puts one of Bivens-Tatum's comments into an interesting light "Attitudes have now changed for many in the West -- in those countries most touched and transformed by Englightenment though"[^18]. This statement is almost commically ridiculous and so entirely Euro-centric that it is breathtaking. The first thing we can understand from this statement is that Bivens-Tatum mostly certainly understands the 'West' as being the most civilized (enlightenment thought is definitely understood by most people to have a 'civilizing' influence). The fact that he non-critically uses the 'West' to demarcate white people from the rest of the world betrays how little he knows (or cares) about the historical context of the enlightenment and of racial politics today, as this fairly common usage entirely depends on erasing the inherent violence of the term 'Western' when one really means 'white'.[^19] That he is most certainly using 'enlightenment' as a stand in for 'civilized' is fairly clear when he talks about being 'touched and transformed.' We exist in a contemporary reality where entire continents have been laid waste by enlightenment values being forced onto them. Entire cultures and peoples have been so thoroughly transformed after being 'touched' by the enlightenment that they no longer even have a history, religion, or culture that would be recognized by their ancestors.

In any case, my hope in this discussion of the enlightenment and its thought and values is to make it clear that the relative worth of the enlightenment and its influence is heavily influenced by an individual's own context. But that, regardless of what Bivens-Tatum assertcs, there is no coherent way to separate out the historical/material realities of the enlightenment from its thought and values.

To further clarify, since Bivens-Tatum engages in an interesting, rhetorical sleight of hand: "If anything, it is the immanent critique within Enlightenment political thought that allows us to view the contrast between the the rhetoric and pratice of, say, Thomas Jefferson, as a contradiction"[^20]. This appears tantamount to Bivens-Tatum asserting that it is _because_ of the enlightenment that we are able to criticize the enlightenment. Essentially, that it is an enlightened value of 'freedom' that allows us to perceive the contradiction of a slave-owner writing about freedom. 

Strangely, this insistence of the complete hegemony of enlightenment values and thought in society today essentially proves the point I've been trying to make about the enlightenment as being one of many tools developed during the height of colonialism as a means for white supremacist dominance over the world. That Bivens-Tatum fails to make room or space for criticisms of the enlightenment that occur from _outside_ of the tradition represents his commitment to the myth-making, hegemony of the enlightenment itself[^21]. This is pretty much demonstrated he states: "Their historical blindness to their own contradictions hardly negates the universal appeal of enlightened political thought"[^22]. 

Part of the point I'm making is that enlightenment values and political ideas do _not_ have universal appeal. And framing this way is, itself, a colonial act. The reality is, is that colonialism has been resisted from the beginning. And it continues to be resisted. Bivens-Tatum's responses to criticcs of the enlightenment has no space for anti-colonial/decolonialization critiques of enlightenment thought and values. 

This is, above all, where my current criticism of libraries is coming from: understanding them as another institution within a white supremacist settler state. And the extent to which libraries embody enlightenment values, this is also a criticims of those values themselves. Because the ongoing existence of the settler state (especially if we are talking about Canada and/or the US) and all of its institutions necessitates continued resistence and working towards decolonization. A small part of which is deconstructing how even cherished and seemingly unassailable institutions like libraries continue the colonial project and, thus, are sites of violence and oppression.

###2.3 'Libraries'

To a large extent, this paper will be focusing on public libraries (or, at least, the _idea_ of public libraries). Libraries obviously existed before the enlightenment. And pre-enlightenment it is pretty easy to see how libraries functioned as a way to entrench social disparities in power (few people were literate, few people had access to libraries, Europe hadn't had the printing press for that long, and education was definitely *not* something that your average person had access to.

Public libraries are also an idea created during this period, one of the (many) institutions created by the ideology of englightenment. As Bivens-Tatum notes in the opening paragraph of his conclusion:

>The scientific and political principles of the Enlightenment provide the philosophical foundation for American academic and public libraries, and the ultimate goal to which these libraries as a system approach -- a universal library available to all -- would be the culmination of the Enlightenment project in the domain of information.[^8]

At this moment in time, it is harder for me to see academic libraries as fitting within this universal model, mainly because academic libraries aren't (often) understood as 'public' or all that accessible to individuals outside of the academic community[^9]. More importantly, it is public libraries that exist within the minds and imaginations of the 'public' as embodying this romanticized ideal. 

##3 The Imaginary Library

###3.1 Library nostalgia and romanticism

For those of us who love libraries, there is a certain kind of nostalgia that attaches to them, particularly if libraries were important to us as youth. And in this nostalgia, in the retelling of how much and what libraries meant to us as children, a certain romanticized narrative is normalized about what libraries are and what they do. And while this romantic notion of libraries creates a lot of enthusiastic defenders and advocates for the library, it also serves to erase the subtle traces of oppression enacted by libraries.

Library nostalgia, at times, is hard to distinguish from readers nostalgia (or book nostalgia). Especially since the common nostalgic library narrative is typically articulated by people who love to read. Who recollect their memories of the library as places where they had access to an unlimited supply of books. Places that nourished their love and joy of reading. They speak of the smell of books, the joy of browsing in the stacks, the delight of discovering books they never knew about, and so on. Sometimes, but not as frequently, these narratives will include actual librarians. But the presence of librarians isn't a necessary feature to library nostalgia. The necessary elements are books and reading. The library merely exists has place par excellence where these things are possible.

Like all nostalgia, these narratives (of course) are always in the distant past. And by 'distant' I don't mean chronologically, but temporally, technologically, conceptually. And this distance is necessary to create the feelings of nostalgia and romance that adheres to libraries. It is what creates the mythology of libraries.

When you read the nostalgia narratives by adults, it is pretty easy to see that libraries are often something that (only) exist for them as children. That they (quite frequently) are not dedicated users of the library today. This is what I mean by 'temporal' distance, since the narratives can be expressed by an adult of any age, they aren't usually talking about a specific era of libraries. Nonetheless, libraries are always something that exist in the past. And, by existing in the past, they are static and unchanging.

This is why there is often a technological distance, as well. Bookless libraries are still fairly new and uncommon. Again, most nostalgia narratives will focus on the older technologies in libraries: the books, the card catalogues, and maybe the odd OPAC or two. This is partly a result of libraries existing only in the past for most adults[^10]. Because libraries are static, they only relevant technologies they have are focused and centered on books.

The conceptual distance also depends on the temporal distance. It derives from the fact that library nostalgia narratives are told by adults from their remembered perspective as children. As a result of not being current users of the library (in many cases), they retain the unnuanced (and often incorrect) conception, understanding of libraries that they had as children, where they may have mistaken circulation assistants for librarians and other such errors. They are left with a conception of the library, based on this nostalgia, that is often idealized. I'm not suggesting, however, that their idealized conception of libraries fundamentally differs from the idealized conception of libraries within the profession, since librarians ourselves are often the most guilty of reifying library nostalgia.

###3.2 Counter-, subversive, and alternative narratives

The nostalgia narrative, though, does have its counterpoints. Thinking of my own experiences with libraries, themselves filtered through some nostalgia, have certain sites of discordance with the common narrative. 

I remember spending hours browsing the stacks at the main branch of the public library as a teen. I'd spend the hour or so on the bus getting downtown to avail myself of the larger selection at the main branch. But the reason why I spent so many hours browsing the stacks was because I was searching for books with characters I might actually be able to identify with. At that period in time I was mainly looking for stories with queer characters. I was mainly able to find stuff for cis gay men, but little else.

So while my experiences of browsing in the stacks and the joys of finding previously unknown 'worlds' mirrors the standard narrative but it also serves as a counter-point. I wasn't searching for escape (although I often did with fantasy and science fiction at that age), instead I was searching for something that would affirm my reality. Something that would help me feel connected to the real world.

In the few studies that have been done to assess the information seeking behaviour of the LGBT community, this is a common experience. In the 2006 paper, "Is there a transgender canon?: Information Seeking and Use in the Transgender Community", the theoretical framework for their investigation centres notion of information gaps as a primary motivator for information seeking, particularly since the information gaps many of the participants were struggling with were often ontological in nature[^11]. Essentially, the transgender respondents of their study sought out information that would confirm/harmonize their understanding of themselves with the external world, rather than escape from it. They were looking for reality-affirming information. As such, it is critically important to note that the internet was highlighted as the most useful place for finding information[^12].

With this understanding, we begin to see the other side of libraries, the one rarely seen or discussed in nostalgia narratives and the side of libraries very much central to this paper: the library as institution. And here, of course, we aren't necessarily talking about the physical buildings and geographical locations of libraries (although these are important parts of the whole), we are talking about the library as socio-economic and political institution. An institution that exists in relation to other socio-economic and political institutions.

As noted in Downey's paper, "librarians are gatekeepers -- the people who decide what their communities would like to read"[^13]. In this role of gatekeeper, it becomes clear that libraries and librarians alike create an institution. And, as institution, can either either be oppressive or liberatory. Nostalgia narratives tend to focus on the liberatory aspects of libraries, highlighting how reading and information provides opportunity and freedom for them.

What happens when the institution (see librarians) engage in activities like 'inside' censorship[^14]? Or when they capitulate to book challenges to remove books targeted to oppressed demographics? Or when, despite clear ethical guidelines, a queer youth can't ask a question without being outed[^15]? What happens when there is so little information for a marginalized group that they no longer even consider the library as a valid source? What does it mean that my research for this very paper has been hampered by most of the few articles about LGBT library users are stuck behind paywalls?

At which point would librarians stop understanding themselves as guardians of intellectual freedom and champions of universal access when there is little-to-no evidence that they do anything beyond serving the interests and needs of the status quo?

##4. Whence libraries? 

###4.1 The historical genesis of libraries

The answer to the questions in the previous partially relies on the history of libraries. Getting in to the history of libraries can take many different paths, but for this paper we are going to follow along with the historical and intellectual context described by Bivens-Tatum in chapter three of _Libraries and the Enlightenment_. The chapter is rather delightfully titled "Public Libraries and the Political Enlightenment", something that rather supports my ideological approach for understading the enlightenment (contrary to what Bivens-Tatum asserts in chapter one).

[^9]: This is despite the reality that many academic libraries do, in fact pay additional money for licensing to their electronic resources so that people outside of the university can access the collections. Additionally, many do have open stacks (or easily obtainable guest passes to their physical collections -- and some with community library cards). However, academic libraries appear to do little in the way of outreach to the external community and very few community members actually know that they are able to make us of these research collections.

[^10]: When I talk about 'most adults' I'm really talking about the middle class, white, cis, hetero adult. Since it is most often their narratives which are nostalgic and it is their narratives that have become normalized when we remember libraries. They, as default human, express the 'universal' library nostalgia. Since it is obvious that counter-narratives, subversive narratives, and the like exist, but they are not often told.

[^19]: While this doesn't really fit into the scope of the paper, I just wanted to point out just how simply the genocide of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas is erased with this quotation, by Matthew Wolfson on the enlightenment, "It was also the period in which North and South America were discovered, depopulated and then repopulated." 'Depopulated' is such a sanitary term for the genocide of _millions_ of people. More to the point, this is on ongoing genocide as settler states like Canada and the US continue the colonial project. This is why using 'western' for 'white' is violent, as it erases the ongoing genocide of the Indigenous people of the Americas. It treats the colonial project of 'depopulating' and 'repopulating' the Americas as finished, when it is pretty clear that Indigenous peoples in Canada and the US continue to resist settler colonialism.
