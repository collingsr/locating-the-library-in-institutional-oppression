#Locating the Library in Institutional Oppression

##Introduction

###The Lay of the Land

The proposition of attempting to understand where the library is located within institutional oppression is a difficult one. First, because institutional oppression itself actively works to disguise, erase, and obfuscate its traces and consequences. It is very much the proverbial devil whose greatest trick is to convince the world that it does not exist. Second, because people sincerely and truly love libraries. They love libraries for a variety of reasons but many tend to associate libraries with a cluster of values that is difficult to gainsay without appearing to side with some fairly unsavoury and undesirable values. 

Neil Gaiman recently wrote this about libraries:

>Libraries are about freedom. Freedom to read, freedom of ideas, freedom of communication. They are about education (which is not a process that finishes the day we leave school or university), about entertainment, about making safe spaces, and about access to information. [^1]

How do you begin a project of locating the library within institutionalized oppression when this quotation represents a common view of libraries? Albeit, even if we understand this as being idealistic and unrealistic, a less idealistic understanding of libraries still frames them largely as institutions for good but ones that, perhaps, occassionally fail to live up to their values.

How do we reconcile this understanding of libraries with the very real fact that we continue to live in a deeply inequitable society? A society where oppression fundamentally structures all of our political, social, and economic relationships and institutions? Exploring the topology and geography of institutional oppression is a perilous activity and frought with many dangers. Starting an expidetion with the goal of finding a much beloved institution will require careful planning.
