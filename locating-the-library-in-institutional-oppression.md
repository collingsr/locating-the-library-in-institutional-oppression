#Locating the Library in Institutional Oppression

##1. Introduction

###1.1 Topological Survey

The proposition of attempting to understand where the library is located within institutional oppression is a difficult one. First, because institutional oppression itself actively works to disguise, erase, and obfuscate its traces and consequences. It is very much the proverbial devil whose greatest trick is to convince the world that it does not exist. Second, because people sincerely and truly love libraries. They love libraries for a variety of reasons but many tend to associate libraries with a cluster of values that is difficult to gainsay without appearing to side with some fairly unsavoury and undesirable values. 

Neil Gaiman recently wrote this about libraries:

>Libraries are about freedom. Freedom to read, freedom of ideas, freedom of communication. They are about education (which is not a process that finishes the day we leave school or university), about entertainment, about making safe spaces, and about access to information. [^1]

How do you begin a project of locating the library within institutionalized oppression when this quotation represents a common view of libraries? Albeit, even if we understand this as being idealistic and unrealistic, a less idealistic understanding of libraries still frames them largely as institutions for good but ones that, perhaps, occassionally fail to live up to their values.

How do we reconcile this understanding of libraries with the very real fact that we continue to live in a deeply inequitable society? A society where oppression fundamentally structures all of our political, social, and economic relationships and institutions? Exploring the topology and geography of institutional oppression is a perilous activity and frought with many dangers. Starting an expidetion with the goal of finding a much beloved institution will require careful planning.

###1.2 Plotting a course

This excursion shall begin by attempting to answer this question: "What are libraries?". It is a question fraught with difficulties and contested areas: however, in a grand sense the ultimate goal of this excursion will be to provide one kind of answer to this question. 

The first answer I'll approach is what the library is in the imagination of the 'public,' as expressed by the articles, defenses, and love letters to the library written by people of varying levels of fame and notoriety. Then I shall attempt to explicate what the library is in the imagination of its labour force using various screed, odes, and rants. 

Next I will delve into the history of libraries to hopefully uncover what libraries were intended to be. This will involve understanding and engaging the notion that libraries are institutions that have been shaped and created as a means to embody and enforce a particular ideology. 

Neither will necessarily be *the* answer, but perhaps they'll contribute to a nuanced and complex understanding of libraries. One which disrupts and challenges the fairly dominant narratives of the library as wholly good by exploring the ways that the library can be bad. 

##2. The Domain of Discourse

###2.1 Institutional oppression

Perhaps one of the more critical elements of this discussion requiring absolute clarity about is the boundaries of what is meant by 'institutional oppression' and what is not. The notion of institutional or systemic oppression speaks to the ways that certain behaviours, attitudes, and ideologies become formalized in the various social, political, and economic organizations, groups, structures, etc. It is about how abstract ideas become reified and concrete through a long, but dynamic and constantly changing, process of human social organization. 

It isn't about how these behaviours, attitudes, and philosophies are emobied in individuals. However, individuals most certainly do come to embody these things and act as the agents of their institutions. Just as other individuals within this system are oppressed by the same institutions. Nonetheless, this isn't an examination of the moral and ethical implications of being oppressive as an individual. 

The focus will remain on institutional oppression for all the ways that how these institutions are structured, created, and maintained reduce the ability for individuals to make a decision to not embody these values. The easiest example within libraries is controlled vocabularies like the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) or the Dewey Decimal Classifications (DDC). There are several well known examples, like the fact that non-Christian religions within the DDC are forced to share a narrow number range because they weren't created with a notion to include them. 

This means that catalogers, whatever their individual beliefs and values *must* continue to enforce this ideological (and white-centric) belief that non-Christian religions are not important (or as important as the Christian ones). The way the DDC is set up, a single cataloger deciding that this exclusion and marginalization of non-Christian religions within the DDC is unacceptable, can do very little to change the overall system. They cannot assign some other number within the DDC and have it be valid or coherent. If they were to use some other system of classification, the resulting records wouldn't work with current technologies, rendering the items inaccessible. Within such a system, making an ethical choice is very difficult on an individual basis. However, focusing on the system or institution allows us to explore solution that would allow individuals to make better decisions. 

Institutional oppression is about the system and processes that we use in our daily lives that, by the very nature of how they've been constructed and devised, exclude, marginalize, and oppress some people to the benefit of others. As such, attempting to locate the library in institutionalized oppression is about identifying the processes and systems within libraries that that instantiate oppressive values and beliefs not necessarily restricted to the library. As a consequence, libraries must also be analyzed in relation to other social, political, and economic institutions that act upon the library and that the library, in turn, impacts. 

###2.2 The Enlightenment

Perhaps the current, definitive work on the relationship between libraries and the enlightenment is, well, _Libraries and the Enlightenment_ by Wayne Bivens-Tatum. Chapter 1 of the book is dedicated to discussing what the enlightenment actually is and lays out the parameters for Bivens-Tatum's discussion. His discussion largely rests on a distinction drawn between enlightenment as historical period and enlightenment as a "set of philosophical and political principles that emerged from this period in history"[^2].

Bivens-Tatum also careful to note his bias towards the enlightenment when he writes: 

>I will be discussing the principles of the Englightenment in a positive way -- in line with numerous historians and philosophers over the last 300 years -- the past few decades have also seen a negative reaction to certain aspects of Enlightenment, or sometimes...[^3]to distortions of Enlightenment thought taken for the real thing.[^4]

In the same spirit, I'll state outright that I think the enlightenment is and was evil. I don't use the word 'evil' lightly, but I'm hard pressed to think of any other word to describe a set of philosophical and political ideas that directly led to the deaths of millions of people and the subjugation of pretty much the entire world under white rule[^5].

My approach to understanding the enlightenment is more holistic than Bivens-Tatum. My general perspective is to understand the enlightenment as an ideology. We cannot separate the philosophical and political ideas of the enlightenment from its historical context. Moreover, we cannot separate how these ideas formed the conceptual basis for many out currently existing political, economic, and social systems.

A discussion I had with Bivens-Tatum on Twitter about out competing perspectives on the enlightenment makes me confident in asserting that he does not agree with me[^6]. Also, that it is an error to conflate the historical reality of the enlightenment and the ideas. I'm okay with this.

I'll illustrate my point with two examples. First, the enlightenment is often credited for its use of rationality and scientific enquiry -- this is often considered one of the key characteristics of the enlightenment. However, at the same time, this is the age of scientific racism. Given that scientific racism has no basic in actual biology (or reality), it seems strange to credit this period for 'rationality' when it was able to conclude that Black people are 3/5ths human. Second, we often praise this period for introducing notions of freedom (and democracy). However, Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence at the same time he owned other human beings. And the society constructed from this declaration remains a deeply unequal one that incarcerates Black men at absurd rates. He wrote this declaration while sitting on stolen land.

These historical realities are non-trivial when it comes to examining the ideas of the enlightenment and how they have travelled through history to organize life today. When Bivens-Tatum writes "the enlightened desire to increase knowledge to benefit not just themselves, but the entire human race"[^7] it is of fundamental importance that, for enlightenment era thinkers, the human race was white men only. That they've managed to create a world that systematically, in all areas of life, benefits white men at the detriment of others, must be understood as the actual purpose of their theorizing about truth, rationality, and freedom. As is often said: the ongoing oppression of non-white, non-men is a feature of enlightenment, not a bug.

###2.3 'Libraries'

To a large extent, this paper will be focusing on public libraries (or, at least, the _idea_ of public libraries). Libraries obviously existed before the enlightenment. And pre-enlightenment it is pretty easy to see how libraries functioned as a way to entrench social disparities in power (few people were literate, few people had access to libraries, Europe hadn't had the printing press for that long, and education was definitely *not* something that your average person had access to.

Public libraries are also an idea created during this period, one of the (many) institutions created by the ideology of englightenment. As Bivens-Tatum notes in the opening paragraph of his conclusion:

>The scientific and political principles of the Enlightenment provide the philosophical foundation for American academic and public libraries, and the ultimate goal to which these libraries as a system approach -- a universal library available to all -- would be the culmination of the Enlightenment project in the domain of information.[^8]

At this moment in time, it is harder for me to see academic libraries as fitting within this universal model, mainly because academic libraries aren't (often) understood as 'public' or all that accessible to individuals outside of the academic community[^9]. More importantly, it is public libraries that exist within the minds and imaginations of the 'public' as embodying this romanticized ideal. 

##3 The Imaginary Library

###3.1 Library nostalgia and romanticism

For those of us who love libraries, there is a certain kind of nostalgia that attaches to them, particularly if libraries were important to us as youth. And in this nostalgia, in the retelling of how much and what libraries meant to us as children, a certain romanticized narrative is normalized about what libraries are and what they do. And while this romantic notion of libraries creates a lot of enthusiastic defenders and advocates for the library, it also serves to erase the subtle traces of oppression enacted by libraries.

Library nostalgia, at times, is hard to distinguish from readers nostalgia (or book nostalgia). Especially since the common nostalgic library narrative is typically articulated by people who love to read. Who recollect their memories of the library as places where they had access to an unlimited supply of books. Places that nourished their love and joy of reading. They speak of the smell of books, the joy of browsing in the stacks, the delight of discovering books they never knew about, and so on. Sometimes, but not as frequently, these narratives will include actual librarians. But the presence of librarians isn't a necessary feature to library nostalgia. The necessary elements are books and reading. The library merely exists has place par excellence where these things are possible.

Like all nostalgia, these narratives (of course) are always in the distant past. And by 'distant' I don't mean chronologically, but temporally, technologically, conceptually. And this distance is necessary to create the feelings of nostalgia and romance that adheres to libraries. It is what creates the mythology of libraries.

When you read the nostalgia narratives by adults, it is pretty easy to see that libraries are often something that (only) exist for them as children. That they (quite frequently) are not dedicated users of the library today. This is what I mean by 'temporal' distance, since the narratives can be expressed by an adult of any age, they aren't usually talking about a specific era of libraries. Nonetheless, libraries are always something that exist in the past. And, by existing in the past, they are static and unchanging.

This is why there is often a technological distance, as well. Bookless libraries are still fairly new and uncommon. Again, most nostalgia narratives will focus on the older technologies in libraries: the books, the card catalogues, and maybe the odd OPAC or two. This is partly a result of libraries existing only in the past for most adults[^10]. Because libraries are static, they only relevant technologies they have are focused and centered on books.

The conceptual distance also depends on the temporal distance. It derives from the fact that library nostalgia narratives are told by adults from their remembered perspective as children. As a result of not being current users of the library (in many cases), they retain the unnuanced (and often incorrect) conception, understanding of libraries that they had as children, where they may have mistaken circulation assistants for librarians and other such errors. They are left with a conception of the library, based on this nostalgia, that is often idealized. I'm not suggesting, however, that their idealized conception of libraries fundamentally differs from the idealized conception of libraries within the profession, since librarians ourselves are often the most guilty of reifying library nostalgia.

###3.2 Counter-, subversive, and alternative narratives

The nostalgia narrative, though, does have its counterpoints. Thinking of my own experiences with libraries, themselves filtered through some nostalgia, have certain sites of discordance with the common narrative. 

I remember spending hours browsing the stacks at the main branch of the public library as a teen. I'd spend the hour or so on the bus getting downtown to avail myself of the larger selection at the main branch. But the reason why I spent so many hours browsing the stacks was because I was searching for books with characters I might actually be able to identify with. At that period in time I was mainly looking for stories with queer characters. I was mainly able to find stuff for cis gay men, but little else.

So while my experiences of browsing in the stacks and the joys of finding previously unknown 'worlds' mirrors the standard narrative but it also serves as a counter-point. I wasn't searching for escape (although I often did with fantasy and science fiction at that age), instead I was searching for something that would affirm my reality. Something that would help me feel connected to the real world.

In the few studies that have been done to assess the information seeking behaviour of the LGBT community, this is a common experience.

[^3]: What is elided here is the reference to another thinker who wrote a book defending the enlightenment. And, yes, if I were a scholar it'd probably be important for me to read this book before saying anything. Fortunately, I'm not a scholar and thus can save my time by not reading a clearly biased and Euro-centric interpretation of the enlightenment.

[^9]: This is despite the reality that many academic libraries do, in fact pay additional money for licensing to their electronic resources so that people outside of the university can access the collections. Additionally, many do have open stacks (or easily obtainable guest passes to their physical collections -- and some with community library cards). However, academic libraries appear to do little in the way of outreach to the external community and very few community members actually know that they are able to make us of these research collections.

[^10]: When I talk about 'most adults' I'm really talking about the middle class, white, cis, hetero adult. Since it is most often their narratives which are nostalgic and it is their narratives that have become normalized when we remember libraries. They, as default human, express the 'universal' library nostalgia. Since it is obvious that counter-narratives, subversive narratives, and the like exist, but they are not often told.
